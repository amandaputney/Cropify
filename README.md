Cropify is a full-stack single-page application that allows users to plan and visualize crop rotation for small scale farms and gardens. This user friendly application will serve as a valuable tool for farmers & gardeners to improve the sustainability and productivity of their harvests. It promotes responsible land management practices, reduces the need for chemical inputs, and contributes to long-term soil health.

### Technologies Used:

- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Express
- React
- Node
- Third Party API

### MVP:

☐ Token Based authentication working

☐ Consume data from [Perenual API](https://perenual.com/docs/api)

☐ Well styled, interactive front end

### User Stories:

- AAU I want to be able to sign-up, log in, and log out
- AAU I want to search a database of crops
- AAU I want to fetch detailed information about a specific crop, including growth requirements based on hardiness zone

### Stretch:

☐ Use Browser API to detect user location and show hardiness zone

☐ Use MapBox for data visualization

☐ Allow users to CRUD specific crop rotation plans
